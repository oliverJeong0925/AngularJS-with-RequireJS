# AngularJS with RequireJS
This simple project is built with AngularJS and RequireJS.
(It's a kind of template to use both together.)

including : 
AngularJS,
RequireJS,
moment js

Usually, I prefer to use jQuery(and jQuery-UI) with AngularJS, but it was not included in this project.

If you want to use jQuery with, define it's path in main.js file and set shim config.
(refer to : http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html)


프로젝트 초반에 시작할때마다 설정 잡는게 귀찮아서 이곳에 프로토타입 형태를 저장해 두는 용도임.
jQuery는 포함하지 않았음.
